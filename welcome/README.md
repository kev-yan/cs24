# Welcome

Welcome to CS 24!  This assignment will make sure you have  Git set up correctly
and are ready to submit your programming projects to Gradescope.


## Git Repo Setup

This class  will use a  single Git repo  for the whole quarter.  Each assignment
will get its own folder within  that repo.  You'll create  a private fork of the
main class repo;  I'll push code to the class repo  as assignments are released,
and you can pull to get the code.

Normally you'd  fork the class repo on GitHub,  but GitHub doesn't allow private
forks of public repos, so this'll be a little more complicated.

First, set up your GitHub account and create a new empty repo:

- Create a GitHub account if you don't already have one.
- Add your SSH key to your GitHub account if it's not there already:
  - Check to see if you have an [existing SSH key][ssh-exists] on your computer.
  - If you don't already have an SSH key, [create one][ssh-create].
  - [Add your SSH key][ssh-github] to your GitHub account.
- Create a new repo on GitHub.
  - GitHub will offer to initialize it with some files.  Don't do this!
  - Make sure it's a private repo.

Then download the class repo onto your local machine and configure it to talk to
both GitHub repos:

- [Install and configure Git][git-setup] if you don't have it already.
- Clone the class repo somewhere on your local machine.
- The class repo will be at a remote named `origin`; rename it to `upstream`.
- Add a new remote for your GitHub repo; call it `origin`.  Use the SSH URL.
- Push your local `main` branch to your GitHub repo (the `-u` option, also
  known as `--set-upstream`, will link your local branch to the remote branch):\
  `git push -u origin main`
- Your files should now be visible in the GitHub web UI.

Then check that you have everything set up correctly:

- Make sure the output of `git remote -v` makes sense.
- Save the output of `git remote -v` as `welcome/remotes.txt`.
- Add and commit this file to your local Git repo.
- Push your changes to GitHub.  You linked your local `main` branch to the
  `main` branch on GitHub in the previous section, so now you can simply use:\
  `git push`


## Git Branches

Now that your repo is set up, get some practice merging:

- The class repo contains one extra branch:
  - `keyname`
- Merge it into your `main` branch.
- Push your changes to GitHub.


## Some Code

Then write some code.

- Create the folder `welcome/code`.
- Create a `caprot.cpp` file  in that folder.  This should  compile to a program
  that takes one `int` as a command line argument,  then reads one line from the
  console.  It should then print that line with the capitalization right-rotated
  by the number of characters given on the command line  (note that the rotation
  wraps around when it reaches the end of the line):
  ```
  [user@host code]$ ./caprot 2
  abC123Def
  abc123deF
  [user@host code]$ ./caprot 5
  AbcdEfghIjklmnOpqrstUvwxYz
  abcDeFghiJklmNopqrsTuvwxyZ
  [user@host code]$ ./caprot -108
  AbcdEfghIjklmnOpqrstUvwxYz
  AbcdEfghijKlmnopQrstUvWxyz
  ```
- Create a `Makefile` inside your `welcome/code` folder.
  - Running `make` in that folder should compile `caprot.cpp` to an executable named `caprot`.
  - Running `make clean` in that folder should remove the executable and any object files.
  - Running `make clean` should succeed even if there is no executable.


## Commit and Submit

- Commit all your changes and push them to GitHub.
- Submit your GitHub repo to Gradescope.
  - You'll be asked to connect your GitHub account to Gradescope if you haven't already.
- Make sure all the tests pass.


## Git Hints

- A Git cheatsheet that may prove helpful:\
  https://xavierholt.github.io/cheatsheets/git.html
- It's always a good idea to run `git status` and see what state your repo is in.
- Git will open a text editor when you make a merge commit, just in case you
  want to edit the automatically generated commit message.  This will probably
  be Vim, so type `:wq` and hit Enter to accept the message and continue.


## Code Hints

- The [cctype][cctype] header contains helpful functions for working with characters.
- All non-letter characters are considered lower case; capitalizing them has no effect.
- Your code should always print exactly one newline, regardless of the input.
- Beware of integer overflow!
- Your code must compile with no warnings (see the syllabus).
- Don't check executables or object files into Git.
